# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

# Overview

This is a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using **React**. It features dynamic player name changes, winner announcements, and a logging system for gameplay events. The project demonstrates React concepts like state management, event handling, and component-based design.

# Features

- Dynamic Player Names: Players can input their names, which are displayed during gameplay. The winner's name is shown in a popup when the game ends.

- Win and Draw Detection: The game announces when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.

- Move Logging: Below the game board, a log keeps track of moves, showing which player selected which cell (e.g., "X selected 0,1").

- Restart/Rematch Button: Players can easily reset the game and start a new match without refreshing the page.

# Key React Concepts Used

- **State Management**: Tracks the state of the board, player names, and the game status.

- **Props**: Passes data between components for rendering and logic.

- **Conditional Rendering**: Displays different UI elements based on the game state (e.g., winner popup).

# Future Enhancements
